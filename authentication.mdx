description: Learn how to authenticate with the DelightLoop API
---

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the x-api-key header of every request.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your DelightLoop account at [https://web.delightloop.ai](https://web.delightloop.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Generate a new API key or use an existing one
4. Copy the key securely

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://new-campiagn-service-delightloop.patchup.health/api/campaigns" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-api-key"
```

## Required Headers

All API requests require the following headers:

- **`x-api-key`**: Your API key (required)
- **`Content-Type`**: `application/json` (required for POST/PUT requests)
- **`x-custom-lang`**: Language preference (optional, defaults to "en")

## API Key

The `x-api-key` header identifies which organization context the request should be executed in. You can find your API key in your account settings.

## API Key Expiration

API keys do not expire unless manually revoked. If you suspect your key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```
