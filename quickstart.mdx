## Get started with DelightLoop API

Learn how to authenticate, create your first contact list, and send a campaign using DelightLoop's powerful API.

### Step 1: Authentication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API key">
    To use the DelightLoop API, you'll need an API key from your DelightLoop dashboard.
    
    1. Log in to your DelightLoop account
    2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
    3. Generate a new API key for your application
    4. Store it securely - you'll use it in the `x-api-key` header
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Make your first authenticated request">
    Test your API key with a simple request:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://apiv1.delightloop.ai/api/campaigns/contact-lists" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    
    <Tip>All DelightLoop API requests require the `x-api-key` header for authentication.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Create your first contact list

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Create a contact list">
    Contact lists are the foundation of your campaigns. Create one with this simple request:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://apiv1.delightloop.ai/api/campaigns/contact-lists" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "My First Contact List",
        "description": "Getting started with DelightLoop API"
      }'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Add contacts to your list">
    Once you have a contact list, add some contacts:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://apiv1.delightloop.ai/api/campaigns/contact-lists/{listId}/contacts" \
      -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "contacts": [
          {
            "email": "sarah.johnson@clientcompany.com",
            "firstName": "Sarah",
            "lastName": "Johnson"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
    
    <Tip>Replace `{listId}` with the ID returned from creating your contact list.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Launch your first campaign

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Create and send a campaign">
  Now create a campaign targeting your contact list:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://apiv1.delightloop.ai/api/campaigns" \
    -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "name": "Welcome Campaign",
      "contactListIds": ["your-contact-list-id"],
      "templateId": "template-id",
      "scheduledAt": "2024-12-25T10:00:00Z"
    }'
  ```
</Accordion>
